# Pok√©dex Tracker

---

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Testing

The project has some unit and e2e tests. Run them using the following commands:

```bash

# Run unit tests
yarn test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run e2e tests 
yarn test:e2e
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js v14: used as the main framework to have some functionality out-of-the-box and focus on implementing the main requirements without having to worry too much about boilerplate code.
- TypeScript: for type safety
- Tailwind: To quickly build a nice-looking (very subjective) UI.
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design): To separate business logic from the application logic. And since it was out of scope to have a proper backend integration, it was easier to use DDD to leave all the business logic in a single part of the application
- Jest + Playwright: for unit and e2e tests

In general I chose this tech stack to have a clear separation of concerns between the business logic and the UI layer, and to have a scalable foundation to allow new things to be added while also having some flexibility on which technologies could be used to integrate new features.

## Application Architecture

The application follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, splitting responsibilities into separate layers:

- **Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic and models (e.g., **Pokedex**, **Pokemon**). This layer is responsible for encapsulating the rules and operations related to the Pok√©dex and its entities.
- **Application Layer:** Contains services (e.g., **PokedexService**) that mediate between the domain and infrastructure layers. This layer is responsible for coordinating actions like adding notes to a Pok√©mon, catching Pok√©mon, and sharing the Pok√©dex.
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Contains repositories (e.g., **PokedexRepository**) that handle data persistence and retrieval. This layer interacts with external systems like local storage or potential APIs.
- **UI Layer:** Built using Next.js. This layer is responsible for rendering the application's UI and handling user interactions.

## Requirements

> See all Pok√©mons that can be caught with their respective name and picture
> 
> See the most important details of each Pok√©mon: Types; Height and Weight; Stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and check the Pok√©mon list

---

> Add Pok√©mon to the Pok√©dex
> 
> For Pok√©mon added to the Pok√©dex: show the date when it was added

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click on the Pok√©ball on a Pok√©mon card

---

> Show Pok√©dex progress

Shown in the Header of all pages.

---

> Pok√©dex page to show only caught Pok√©mon

Add some Pok√©mon to you Pok√©dex on the homepage and click on the "Your Pok√©dex" link.

---

> Share any Pok√©mon with others

This was a bit unclear. So my idea was to make a "share" page which shows the user's Pok√©dex.

Add some Pok√©mon to you Pok√©dex on the homepage, click on the "Your Pok√©dex" link and then click on the "Share Pok√©dex" button.

---

> Have access to my Pok√©dex with limited internet connectivity

Pok√©dex data is persisted in localStorage so you can access your Pok√©dex data offline, and if React-Query cached the PokeApi response, you can also see the Pok√©mon list on the homepage.

---

> Manage my Pok√©dex:
> 
> 1. Filter and sort Pok√©mon by: name, height, timestamp
> 2. Remove one or multiple Pok√©mon at once
> 3. Attach a free-text note to each Pok√©mon

All options (except remove multiple Pok√©mon at once) are done via the Pok√©dex page

---

> Export all Pok√©mons from the Pok√©dex to CSV


Add some Pok√©mon to you Pok√©dex on the homepage, click on the "Your Pok√©dex" link and then click on the "Export Pok√©dex to CSV" button.

## Possible improvements

If we would want to make this application production-ready there are some improvement I would like to make:

1. Backend Integration: Currently, the application uses local storage for persistence. For a production-ready app, we could add a proper database service and use localStorage as the fallback option
2. Authentication: Integrate user authentication to enable user-specific Pok√©dex lists
3. Error Monitoring: Use an error monitoring service to track errors in production
4. State Management: In general the app is simple so I could use just a single Context to share some data/logic across multiple pages, but we would probably need a more robust solution if the app got bigger and more data/features were added
5. Accessibility: Ensure that the application follows best practices for accessibility in all components. I've tried to make it work for most things, but probably would need a second-pass to fix some uncaught issues
